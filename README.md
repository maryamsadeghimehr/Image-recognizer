# Image-recognizer
We have used convolutional neural networks to identify handwritten digits using MNIST dataset of digits images. We also used a database of 44406 fruit images, which were collected in a period of 6 months, to recognize the fruits. Both of these image recognision projects are part of the kaggle competions.
